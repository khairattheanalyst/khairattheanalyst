## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am passionate about exploring and visualizing data to uncover trends and patterns that drive meaningful insights. With a strong background in statistical analysis, I aim to apply my skills to solve real-world problems and make data-driven decisions. I am proficient in tools such as SQL, Excel, and R, and I have experience creating impactful visualizations using Tableau and Power BI. I excel at working with large datasets and translating complex data into actionable results. Currently, I am seeking entry-level roles or internship opportunities where I can contribute to impactful projects, develop my expertise further, and grow as a data analyst.
