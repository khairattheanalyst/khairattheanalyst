## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a curious and data-driven analyst with a background in Statistics and a love for turning numbers into metrics and insights. My journey into tech started with creativity, from 3D design to Product Design... but I found my true spark in Data Analysis. Since then, I've been learning, experimenting, and building my skills one dataset at a time.

Over the past months, I've worked on real-world projects across domains like FinTech, E-commerce, Health Tech, Cybersecurity, Environmental Tech, and Freelance Tech, exploring user behavior, sales trends, and performance metrics. Iâ€™m proficient in SQL, Excel, R, Python, and I create impactful dashboards using Tableau and Power BI. I also bring the analytical mindset of a Statistician and the curiosity of a problem-solver to the table.

Right now, Iâ€™m seeking entry-level roles or internships where I can contribute, collaborate, and continue growing as an analyst. I believe in learning out loud, and Iâ€™m excited to keep sharing my journey and connecting with people doing great work in the data space.
